# CUBE CSS Boilerplate 

ðŸš¨ **PLEASE READ THIS EXPLAINER**: https://piccalil.li/blog/a-css-project-boilerplate ðŸš¨

## Contributing

This is a boilerplate that **works for us**, here at [Set Studio](https://set.studio/), so please donâ€™t propose changes. If you do however find a bug, please raise an issue first before a pull request. Any pull request that is raised without an issue will be closed automatically.

Issues will also be closed automatically if theyâ€™re opinions rather than bug reports. 

Thank you! 

## Getting started 

After running `npm install` run `npm start`. This will serve up a local version of the HTML page and watch for CSS changes. 

The task doesnâ€™t currently watch for changes on the HTML document though. This is because we normally drop the CSS system into various types of projects in the studio.
